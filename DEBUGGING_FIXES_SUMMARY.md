# Debugging Fixes Summary

## Date: October 25, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ❌ Deepgram API Key Loading Issue (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Server logs showed "Deepgram API key not configured" despite key being present in `.env.local`

### 2. ❌ WebSocket Connection Instability (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Multiple rapid connect/disconnect events on page load, especially in React Strict Mode

## Part 1: Backend Fixes - Deepgram API Key Loading

### File: `copilot-server/src/index.ts`

#### Changes Made:
- ✅ Added comprehensive environment variable verification at startup
- ✅ Logs show which API keys are loaded with partial key display for security
- ✅ Immediately visible on server start if any keys are missing

#### What to Look For:
When you start the server, you should now see:
```
========================================
🔧 Environment Variables Check:
   PORT: 3001 (default)
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY: ✅ Loaded (b700b99e...f3c8)
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ✅ Loaded (...X7eg)
   FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY: ✅ Loaded (...3cc0)
========================================
```

### File: `copilot-server/src/services/speechToText.ts`

#### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **Removed empty string fallback**: Changed from `|| ''` to no fallback
2. ✅ **Strict validation in `getDeepgramClient()`**: Now checks for `null`, `undefined`, AND empty strings
3. ✅ **Detailed error logging**: Clear instructions if API key is missing
4. ✅ **Client creation logging**: Shows first 8 and last 4 characters of key when creating client
5. ✅ **Enhanced `start()` method logging**: Shows progression through initialization

#### Key Improvements:
```typescript
// OLD (line 5)
const deepgramApiKey = process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY || '';

// NEW
const deepgramApiKey = process.env.DEEPGRAM_API_KEY;
```

```typescript
// OLD getDeepgramClient()
if (!deepgramClient && deepgramApiKey) {
  deepgramClient = createClient(deepgramApiKey);
}

// NEW getDeepgramClient()
if (!deepgramApiKey || deepgramApiKey.trim() === '') {
  console.error('FATAL ERROR: DEEPGRAM_API_KEY environment variable is not set or empty.');
  // ... detailed error message
  return null;
}
// ... creates client with try/catch and logging
```

#### Expected Logs:
When transcription starts, you should see:
```
🎤 Starting Deepgram transcriber...
🔄 Attempting to create Deepgram client...
   API Key (first 8/last 4 chars): b700b99e...f3c8
✅ Deepgram client created successfully
✅ Deepgram client obtained, proceeding with connection...
```

## Part 2: Frontend Fixes - WebSocket Connection Stability

### File: `copilot-ui/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`

#### Root Cause:
- React Strict Mode in development calls effects twice
- Cleanup function was calling `disconnect()` which was in dependency array
- No flag to distinguish intentional vs accidental disconnects
- Event handlers weren't nullified before closing, allowing reconnect logic to fire

#### Changes Made:

1. ✅ **Added `intentionalDisconnectRef`**: Tracks whether disconnect was user-initiated
   ```typescript
   const intentionalDisconnectRef = useRef(false);
   ```

2. ✅ **Improved `connect()` function**:
   - Resets `intentionalDisconnectRef` to `false` when connecting
   - Already had guards against multiple simultaneous connections

3. ✅ **Enhanced `onclose` handler**:
   - Now checks THREE conditions before reconnecting:
     - `!intentionalDisconnectRef.current` (not intentional)
     - `shouldConnectRef.current` (should maintain connection)
     - `reconnectCountRef.current < reconnectAttempts` (haven't exceeded retries)
   - Better logging to identify why reconnection didn't happen

4. ✅ **Updated `disconnect()` function**:
   - Sets `intentionalDisconnectRef.current = true` FIRST
   - Nullifies ALL event handlers before closing WebSocket
   - Prevents any reconnection logic from firing

5. ✅ **Fixed useEffect cleanup**:
   - No longer calls `disconnect()` (removes dependency issue)
   - Manually performs cleanup inline
   - Sets `intentionalDisconnectRef.current = true`
   - Nullifies event handlers before closing
   - Only depends on `[connect]`, not `[connect, disconnect]`

#### Key Code Changes:

**Before (problematic cleanup):**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  connect();
  return () => {
    disconnect(); // Calls function in dependency array
  };
}, [connect, disconnect]); // Both in deps, can cause issues
```

**After (stable cleanup):**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  connect();
  return () => {
    // Manual cleanup - no function calls
    intentionalDisconnectRef.current = true;
    shouldConnectRef.current = false;
    // ... nullify event handlers
    // ... close WebSocket
    // ... clear timeouts
  };
}, [connect]); // Only connect in deps
```

### File: `copilot-ui/src/components/SidecarView.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
- ✅ **Minor optimization**: Removed stable `setState` functions from `handleWebSocketMessage` dependency array
  - React's `setState` functions are stable and don't need to be listed
  - Cleaner dependency array: `[queueAudioChunk]` instead of `[queueAudioChunk, setTranscript, setAiResponse]`

#### All useCallback Usage Verified:
- ✅ `initAudioContext` - stable, no dependencies
- ✅ `playNextInQueue` - stable, no dependencies  
- ✅ `queueAudioChunk` - correct dependencies
- ✅ `handleWebSocketMessage` - optimized dependencies
- ✅ `clearAudioQueue` - stable, no dependencies
- ✅ `handleMuteToggle` - correct dependencies
- ✅ `handleEndSession` - correct dependencies
- ✅ `handleStartStop` - correct dependencies

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Deepgram API Key Loading

**Start the server:**
```bash
cd copilot-server
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
========================================
🔧 Environment Variables Check:
   PORT: 3001 (default)
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY: ✅ Loaded (b700b99e...f3c8)
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ✅ Loaded (...X7eg)
   FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY: ✅ Loaded (...3cc0)
========================================

🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3001
🔌 WebSocket server ready on ws://localhost:3001/ws
```

**When you click "Start Recording":**
```
WebSocket client connected
🎤 Starting Deepgram transcriber...
🔄 Attempting to create Deepgram client...
   API Key (first 8/last 4 chars): b700b99e...f3c8
✅ Deepgram client created successfully
✅ Deepgram client obtained, proceeding with connection...
🔄 Initiating Deepgram connection...
✅ Deepgram connection opened successfully
```

### 2. Test WebSocket Stability

**Start the frontend:**
```bash
cd copilot-ui
npm run dev
```

**Open browser to http://localhost:3000**

**Expected Console Logs (clean connection):**
```
🎯 useWebSocket: Effect running - establishing connection
🔌 Initiating WebSocket connection...
✅ WebSocket connected successfully
```

**What You Should NOT See:**
- ❌ Multiple "WebSocket client connected" in rapid succession
- ❌ Immediate disconnect followed by reconnect
- ❌ "Connection already in progress" warnings

**In React Strict Mode:**
- First mount: Connects → Cleanup disconnects
- Second mount: Connects and stays connected
- Total server logs: 2 connections (one cleaned up immediately)
- This is NORMAL and expected in development with Strict Mode

### 3. Test Recording Flow

1. Click "Start Recording" button
2. Speak into microphone
3. Watch for transcript updates
4. Click "Stop Recording"

**Expected Server Logs:**
```
Received message: {"type":"start_recording"}
🎤 Starting Deepgram transcriber...
✅ Deepgram connection opened successfully
Received audio chunk: 640 bytes
📝 Transcript event received (isConnected: true)
⏳ Interim transcript: "hello"
✅ Final transcript: "hello world"
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Deepgram Still Fails:

1. **Check .env.local location**: Must be in `copilot-server/.env.local`
2. **Check file format**: No quotes around values, no spaces
3. **Restart server**: Changes to .env require server restart
4. **Check API key validity**: Log into Deepgram dashboard to verify key is active

### If WebSocket Still Unstable:

1. **Check browser console**: Look for connection errors
2. **Disable Strict Mode temporarily**: In `copilot-ui/src/app/layout.tsx`, remove `<React.StrictMode>`
3. **Clear browser cache**: Old WebSocket connections may be cached
4. **Check for multiple instances**: Ensure only one server is running on port 3001

## Self-Correction Note

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The Deepgram API key issue cannot be fixed solely through code if:
- The API key itself is invalid or expired
- The Deepgram account has billing issues
- The API key doesn't have the necessary permissions

The code changes ensure you get **clear error messages** directing you to the exact problem, but you may still need to:
- Log into your Deepgram account at https://deepgram.com
- Verify the API key is active
- Check account billing status
- Generate a new API key if needed

The same applies to Fish Audio (402 Payment Required error from previous debugging session).

## Summary of Files Modified

1. ✅ `copilot-server/src/index.ts` - Added startup env verification
2. ✅ `copilot-server/src/services/speechToText.ts` - Strict API key validation & logging
3. ✅ `copilot-ui/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - Fixed connection stability
4. ✅ `copilot-ui/src/components/SidecarView.tsx` - Optimized useCallback dependencies

## Expected Outcome

✅ **Deepgram Issue**: Server logs will clearly show if the API key is loaded and where it fails
✅ **WebSocket Issue**: Only 1-2 connections on page load (2 in Strict Mode is normal), stable connection maintained
✅ **Overall**: Clear, actionable error messages guide you to the root cause of any remaining issues
